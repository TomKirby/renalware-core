# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum, this matches the default thread size of Active Record.

# Specifies the `environment` that Puma will run in.
#
environment ENV.fetch("RAILS_ENV") { "development" }

# Specifies the number of `workers` to boot in clustered mode.
# Workers are forked webserver processes. If using threads and workers together
# the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
# Workers do not work on JRuby or Windows (both of which do not support
# processes).
#

# Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
# This directive tells Puma to first boot the application and load code
# before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
# process behavior so workers use less memory. If you use this option
# you need to make sure to reconnect any threads in the `on_worker_boot`
# block.

# There is no request timeout mechanism inside of Puma. The Heroku router will timeout all requests
# that exceed 30 seconds. Although an error will be returned back to the client, Puma will continue
# to work on the request as there is no way for the router to notify Puma that the request
# terminated early. To avoid clogging your processing ability we recommend using Rack::Timeout
# to terminate long running requests and locate their source.
# Add the Rack Timeout gem to your project then in an initializer set the value to something lower
# than 30:
# config/initializers/timeout.rb
#   Rack::Timeout.timeout = 20  # seconds
# Now any requests that continue for 20 seconds will be terminated and a stack trace output to your
# logs. The stack trace should help you determine what part of your application is causing the
# timeout so you can fix it.

# The code in the `on_worker_boot` will be called if you are using
# clustered mode by specifying a number of `workers`. After each worker
# process is booted this block will be run, if you are using `preload_app!`
# option you will want to use this block to reconnect to any threads
# or connections that may have been created at application boot, Ruby
# cannot share connections between processes.
