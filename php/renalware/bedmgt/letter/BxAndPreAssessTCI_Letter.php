<p><b>Location</b>: Renal Outpatients, 1st Floor, Cheyne Wing.</p>
<p>Whilst every effort is made to ensure that beds are available for waiting list cases, emergencies can arise which mean that your admission has to be re-booked.</p>
<p><b>On the agreed admission date, you will be required to be on the ward between 10am-1pm. We will confirm the exact time on the morning of your admission. Please ensure that you are available and able to come in promptly when asked to do so.</b></p>

<p>If the dates arranged are inconvenient and if you are unsure why you are coming into hospital, or you have a cough or a cold on the day of your admission, please do not hesitate to contact me. If you plan to cancel let me know as soon as possible, so another patient may be given the chance to attend.</p>
