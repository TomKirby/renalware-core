echo "Dear $title $firstnames $lastname,</p>

<p>An admission date has been agreed with you under the care of your Consultant.</p>
<p>For <b>$proced</b></p>
<p><b>On $tcidate_ddmy </b></p>
<p>Location:<b> Short Stay Facility on Matthew Whiting Ward</b>, first floor of Cheyne Wing</p>
<p>Time:<b> Please come to the hospital at 8am.</b> You must come in for 8am so that
 we can make sure you are fully prepared for your procedure on time. You do not need to confirm your bed on the day of admission. You may go directly to Matthew Whiting ward</p>
<p>Whilst every effort will be made to ensure that beds are available for waiting list cases, emergencies can arise which may mean that your admission has to be rebooked.</p>
<p><b>If you have any queries regarding your dialysis arrangements, reason for admission or if you are taking aspirin, warfarin or clopidogrel, please contact the Access Nurse Specialist team on 0203 299 6776.</b></p>
<p>Please note that as your stay may only be for one night or less, you will not be dispensed your regular medication on discharge. Therefore please ensure that your GP supplies are up to date.</p>
<p>If the date arranged becomes inconvenient or you are unwell on the day of your admission, please do not hesitate to contact me on 0203 299 3107. Failure to attend this admission without cancelling in advance will result in a wasted procedure slot and you may be removed from the waiting list. Please let me know as soon as possible of any plans you have to change your admission so that another patient can be given the chance to attend.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely
<br>
<br>
